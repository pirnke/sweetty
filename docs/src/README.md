# Sweetty

Terminal utilities and widgets for the cool people living in a terminal.

A modular toolkit for sysadmins, developers, and DevOps folks who spend their
lives in tmux. Built in Rust for minimal overhead - because your status bar
shouldn't slow you down.

## Planned Features

- **System monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk, network, battery
- **Git integration**: branch status, ahead/behind, commit logs
- **Development tools**: build watch, test runner, log tailing
- **Productivity**: pomodoro timer, calendar, tasks
- **Network utilities**: ping, traceroute, bandwidth monitoring
- **Eye candy**: analog clock, matrix effect, audio visualizer

## Status

Work in progress. Coming soon!
