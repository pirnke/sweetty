Terminal utilities and widgets for the cool people living in a terminal.

A modular toolkit for sysadmins, developers, and DevOps folks who spend their
lives in tmux. Built in Rust for minimal overhead - because your status bar
shouldn't slow you down.

**Key features** (planned):

- System monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, network, battery)
- Git status and visualization
- Development tools (build watch, test runner, log tailing)
- Productivity widgets (pomodoro, calendar, tasks)
- Network utilities (ping, traceroute, bandwidth monitoring)
- Visual demonstrations (analog clock, matrix effect, audio visualizer)

Work in progress. Coming soon!
